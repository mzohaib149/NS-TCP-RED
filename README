To run the script

ns [RED|Droptail] [1|2]

It creates output_[RED|DROPTAIL]_[1|2] depending on one of the six combinations for which it is run

The format of these output files is:

Time for calculation: 1 sec
Now: 180 sec 
Number of bytes received at sink1: 
Throughput at sink1:  kbps
Number of bytes received at sink2: 
Throughput at sink2: kbps
It also displays at console: 

"Throughput at sink1: [expr $bw1] kbps"
"Throughput at sink2: [expr $bw2] kbps"	
"Throughput at sink3: [expr $bw3] kbps"



It also creates output files [DROPTAIL|RED]_[1|2]_[average|instantaneous]_sink[1|2|3].tr

These files record time and average and instantaneous bandwidth at sink1, sink2 and sink3 (if available) starting for t=30 to 180sec in intervals of 1 sec.
This file is then used as input for Xgraph to plot time vs. average throughput and time vs. instantaneous throughput for all sinks in a graph.
